you just like do the thing and then yippy


run "nano .bash_aliases" in ur home directory (ur terminal should open to there automaticly)

then at the bottom add "alias gubby=/path/to/this/folder/gubby.sh"

make sure you go from the root dir.  if its in ur home folder it would be 
/home/[username]/gubby_scripts/gubby.sh

once all of that is typed in press control o then enter then control x 

then open a new terminal or run "source .bash_aliases"

then run "gubby"
if it says command not found then you might have a problem
let me break it down 
   _O/                   ,
     \                  /           \O_
     /\_             `\_\        ,/\/
     \  `       ,        \         /
     `       O/ /       /O\        \
             /\|/\.                `


bash does not automaticly refresh aliases and other things in .bashrc
(.bashrc (in ur home folder) has a lot of thing configuring bash, including adding all the aliases from .bash_aliases)
it only get stuff from there when bash starts. 
so to update things try running "source .bash_aliases" this makes bash refresh the config from this file
then run gubby
if that does not work open a new termial and run gubby

if none of that works uhhhhh thats a problem
good luck
